Palpitate - Machnie Learning thingy

Java code should go into src/main/java. Tests should go into src/test/java.

Use gradle (http://gradle.org/) to build and run the project. Use gradle check command to compile and run the project. This ensures compatiability with TravisCI. InteliJ (and presumably other IDEs) can be configured to use gradle.
