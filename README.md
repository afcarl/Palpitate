Palpitate - Machine Learning thingy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/group-24/Palpitate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/group-24/Palpitate)

Java code should go into src/main/java. Tests should go into src/test/java.

Use gradle (http://gradle.org/) to build and run the project. Use gradle check command to compile and run the project. This ensures compatibility with TravisCI. IntelliJ (and presumably other IDEs) can be configured to use gradle.
Do not submit pull requests before running tests and running gradle check as they will not be accepted and will waste time.
